# Introduction
Rustle is a backend application designed for organizing and managing projects within collaborative workspaces.

It provides a feature-rich platform for handling **users**, **workspaces**, and **projects**, making it easy for teams to structure work, coordinate effectively, and maintain clarity across multiple initiatives.

Rustle was created to simplify the process of **managing users, projects, and workspaces** in one place.

By combining project management, workspace collaboration, and role-based user control, Rustle serves as a backbone for teams that need both **flexibility** during development and **stability** in production.

Rustle is designed to run in containerized environments, which means you donâ€™t have to worry about local setup or system dependencies. Everything runs consistently across development machines and servers.

# Prerequisites
Rustle can be run entirely with **Docker**, making setup and management straightforward and consistent across machines.

Before running Rustle, ensure you have installed the following **prerequisites**:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
> Check versions with `docker --version` and `docker compose version`.
